## CODE AND DATA FILES 

Three types of files (not including this readme file) are stored on this repository: code files, data files and figure files.


### Code file

All code is written in R. R is a statistical programming language and software package that is distributed under a GNU General Public License. R documentation and software is available for free download through the R Project for Statistical Computing website at http://www.r-project.org. The software is available as an executable file for a wide variety of operating systems and computer architectures, and a compilable binary is also available should you need it.

  SimpactPaperEAAAExample.R -- This file contains the script to generate the data, run the analysis and produce the figures for the ART coverage, HIV incidence and HIV prevalence over time. The analysis compares the ART coverage, HIV incidence and HIV prevalence over time.
  
  SimpactPaperPhyloExample.R -- This file contains the script to generate the data, run the analysis and produce the figures for the HIV transmission network, time-resolved phylogenetic tree, and the distribution of internal nodes in the reconstructed phylogenetic tree and simulated HIV transmission events.


### Data files
  
  SimpactPaperEAAAExample.RData -- This file is an RData object, containing the data needed for the reproduction of the figures in the "Early Access to ART for All" (EAAA) example. These are the model input parameter values and the model output statistics for 20 simulations under an EAAA scenario (a policy of immediate access to ART for all people infected with HIV from October 2016), and an alternative scenario (CD4 cell count threshold for ART eligibility stays at 500 cells/microliter from mid 2013 onwards). 

  SimpactPaperPhyloExample.RData -- This file is an RData object, containing the data needed for the reproduction of the figures in the phylo example. These data are: transNet.yrs.Old (HIV transmission network object), dater.tree (time-stamped phylogenetic tree), i.vec (vector of calendar years), int.node.vec (vector of the number of internal nodes in one-year calendar time intervals), and numb.tra (vector of the number of transmission events in one-year calendar time intervals).

  hiv.seq.B.pol.j.fasta -- This file is a fasta file of the HIV subtype B pol gene sequence of the seed infection (root of the phylogenetic tree).
  
  
### Figure files

  cov.FaFc.plot.pdf -- Panel A of the figure shown in the EAAA example.
  
  inc.FaFc.plot.pdf -- Panel B of the figure shown in the EAAA example.
  
  prev.FaFc.plot.pdf -- Panel C of the figure shown in the EAAA example.
  
  network_vsc.pdf -- Panel A of the figure shown in the phylo example.
  
  tree_vsc.pdf -- Panel B of the figure shown in the phylo example.
  
  events_vsc.pdf -- Panel C of the figure shown in the phylo example.  
  

## SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### Operating system

  We have only tested this code on personal computers (OS X Version 10.11.6 and Linux Ubuntu Version 16.04), and on the lengau cluster at the Cape Town Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and the golett cluster of the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC).

### Required software

  R version 3.4.4
  
  In order for the phylo example to work, you need to add the executable tools "Seq-Gen", and "FastTree" to your working directory, as well as the root viral gene sequence (hiv.seq.B.pol.j.fasta).

  Seq-Gen version 1.3.4. <https://github.com/rambaut/Seq-Gen/releases/tag/1.3.4> Simulates viral evolution across a transmission network and produces a sequence alignment. To install Seq-Gen, do the following:
  
  1. Visit the following Github repository to download the latest version of Seq-Gen: <https://github.com/rambaut/Seq-Gen/releases/tag/1.3.4>
  2. Click on the "Source Code" zip file to download
  3. Click on the zip file to unzip the folder
  4. Navigate to the source folder to confirm there is a file called "Makefile"
  5. Now you will need to compile the program using the Terminal on your computer
  6. Via the Terminal, change your working directory to the source folder by typing after the prompt: `cd "file/path/here/Seq-Gen-1.3.4 2/source"`
  7. Once your working directory has been set to the source folder, type after the prompt: `make`
  8. Now open the source folder and verify that a new file is present called "seq-gen"
  9. Copy that file and paste it into your R working directory

  FastTree version 2.1.10. <http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install> Reconstructs a phylogenetic tree from a large alignment dataset. To install FastTree, do the following:
  
  1. Visit the website for downloading instructions: <http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install>
  2. If you have a Linux operating system, you can directly download the executable files that are linked on that website. Those downloaded files can then be placed in your R working directory
  3. If you are using an OS X operating system, open the link "FastTree.c" in a new browser window
  4. Right-click on the program and click "Save as"
  5. Save anywhere on your computer
  6. Open the Terminal on your computer and change your working directory to the folder that contains "FastTree.c". After the prompt type:  `cd "file/path/here"`
  7. After the directory has been changed, after the prompt type: `gcc -O3 -finline-functions -funroll-loops -Wall -o FastTree FastTree.c -lm`
  8. Now check to see if a new executable file has been created in that folder
  9. Copy that file and paste it into your R working directory

  SimpactCyan version 0.21 and RSimpactCyan. SimpactCyan is the core program that allows fast simulation of HIV transmission across a sexual network. RSimpactCyan is the R package that enables initiation and running of models built by SimpactCyan. Installation instructions for both are at: <https://github.com/j0r1/RSimpactCyan/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md>

  A long list of auxiliary R packages is required to run the post-simulation analysis for the MaxART and phylo examples in the paper.
